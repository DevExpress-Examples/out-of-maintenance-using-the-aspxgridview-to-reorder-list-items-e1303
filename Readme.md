# Using the ASPxGridView to reorder list items


<p>In this example, the ASPxGridView is used to reorder a list stored in the Session state.<br />
It is possible to move several items simultaneously: select multiple rows using Shift and Ctrl keys and use buttons in the grid's status bar to move selected items up or down.</p>
